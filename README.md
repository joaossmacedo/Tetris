This project was developed for the discipline of "Linguagem de Programação Imperativa"(Imperative Programming Language).
As this project started while I was on my first undergraduate term, the earlier commits are fully written in portuguese.

Team: Ademario Junior, Antonio Vitor, Danilo Felipe, Guilherme Francisco and João Macedo.

In may/2018 I decided to update this code, these changes can be seen on the branch update. Now the code is fully translated into english and is better organized.
