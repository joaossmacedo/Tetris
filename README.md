# Tetris
This project was made for the subject of LPI (Imperative Programming Language).
As this code was made while I was on my first undergraduate term, it's fully written in portuguese.

The teacher divided the classroom in groups, then he informed that each group would write their own Tetris in C and it would
work as one of our term grades. By the end of the term (july/17) we delivered the code to the teacher. 

My group was composed of Ademario Junior, Antonio Vitor, Danilo Felipe, Guilherme Francisco and Jo√£o Macedo(me).
