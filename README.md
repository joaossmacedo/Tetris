# Tetris
This project was made for the subject of LPI (Imperative Programming Language).
As this code was made while I was on my first undergraduate term, the earlier commits are fully written in portuguese.

The teacher divided the class in groups, then he informed that each group would write their own Tetris in C and it would
work as one of our term grades. By the end of the term (july/17) we delivered the code to the teacher. 

My group was composed of Ademario Junior, Antonio Vitor, Danilo Felipe, Guilherme Francisco and Jo√£o Macedo(me).

In may/2018 I decided to update this code, these changes can be seen on the branch update. Now the code is fully translated into english and is better organized.
